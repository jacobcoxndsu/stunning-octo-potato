## The Blob Project

This Project is the attempt at creating something fun and enjoyable, while also using the skills I have aquired over the course of a year in web development. 

This game will be a blob based game where you control a "colony" of phages and you attack other cells and take them over to progress and get bigger and more powerful. 

This is the quest to become the ultimate life form, in terms of blobs of course.  

## Dependencies

You will need the following pieces of software:

* Nodejs

This software is primarily tested on MacOS and Ubuntu 18.04, with Apache as a reverse proxy.

## Usage

To use, download or clone the project. Navigate to `server` and run:

```
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3001. To change this, edit `config.json` and change your parameters accordingly.

Within the server folder is the `client` folder. This is where any client-side rendering and effects are handled.
